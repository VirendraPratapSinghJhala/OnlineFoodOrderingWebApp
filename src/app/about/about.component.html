      <h1>About Us</h1><br>
	  <h4>Shaping the Future of food.</h4>
	  <h4>Our goal is to change what you eat.</h4>
      <p> We are committed to nurturing a neutral platform and are helping food establishments maintain high standards through Hyperpure.
	  Food Hygiene Ratings is a coveted mark of quality among our restaurant partners. </p>
      <p>We push ourselves beyond our abilities when faced with tough times.
	  When we foresee uncertainty, we address it only with flexibility.
      Feedback is never taken personally,
	  we break it into positive pieces and strive to work on each and every element even more effectively.	  
	  It’s always ‘us’ over ‘me’. We don’t lose ourselves in pride or confidence during individual successes,
	  but focus on being our simple selves in every which way.We believe in, stand for and are evangelists of our culture - both,
	  within "Food On Way" and externally with all our stakeholders.
	  It’s not our abilities that show who we truly are - it’s our choices.
	  We aim to get these right, at least in the majority of the cases.  
	  </p>
	  <p> People here don’t work ‘for’ Food On Way, they work ‘with’ Food On Way.
	  We treat every problem as our own, take accountability and drive the change.</p>
